# codealpha_task2_SalesPrediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting future sales. The goal is to help businesses optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and improve revenue forecasting by accurately estimating future demand.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and encodes categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes sales trends, seasonality, and correlations.

Model Training: Implements and compares various models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA/LSTM for time series).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV for optimal model performance.

Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
